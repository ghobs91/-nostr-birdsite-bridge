Nostr Birdsite Bridge scans the people you follow on Twitter and then generates Nostr profiles that mirror their posts, so you can follow them right from your favorite Nostr client! In essence, it turns Twitter into somewhat of another big relay for Nostr.

Make sure to add the **wss://rsslay.nostr.moe** relay in order to be able to see the profiles' posts.

Note: for the meantime I've limited it to the first 200 Twitter profiles while I work out the kinks, and to not hammer wss://rsslay.nostr.moe all at once.
